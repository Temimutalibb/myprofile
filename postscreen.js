        And he told me, 'We will build something together.' I said, 
        'I'm not popular, I can't fetch 
        you the millions.' He said, 
        'You are already popular.
         How did I get to know you if you are 
         not famous? You are not a lost cause.
        If you want to get big, go out there and get big.
        If you want to be a winner, you need to stop losing. 
        Guess who has stopped losing? Those are people six feet under the ground. 
        So go out there and be a loser. Remember, 
        losing got you this far, losing got you this

        <h6>The Facade of Dreams</h6>
        As my dreams got taller, my vision became blurrier.
        I was happy; I thought I was doing something. 
        When I looked to the left and right, 
        I saw nothing had changed. I looked behind me, 
        and it was still the same as I had left it.
        I couldn't see in front of me because the dream 
        I built had blocked my vision. 
        I didn't know if anything had changed ahead. 
        That was a wake-up call for me. 
        How could I be sure this wasn't a facade? I was right; 
        it was a dune—dunes of sand. Now, I am taking one step at a time: build, 
        take a step; build, take a step. 
        Now I can see everything clearly. 
        I know when to slow down, divert, revert, and speed up.

        <h6>Is web 2 dying off</h6>
        The answer is a capital NO, not now, not ever. 
        Web 3 is making waves, which is normal,
        but Web 2.0 is going nowhere. 
        Web 2.0 stands as the intermediate or backbone of the web. 
        Most Web 3 functionalities still depend on Web 2.0,
        and it’s still the most widely used web. 
        As a web developer, if you are worried about the 
        future because of how saturated the web space is, 
        it is worth being concerned about.
        However, what you need to do is not miss the 
        future—upskill yourself and get ready for it.
        The future of Web 2.0, though, is web extensions. 
        As a web developer, make sure web extensions are in your portfolio.
        Learn how to build web extensions for major web browsers. 
        I will be writing steps on building web extensions and the projects to work on. 
        I will also start an open-source project based on web extensions soon. Subscribe to my newsletter for my subsequent posts.
